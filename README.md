# E-Commerce Website Database Code

This SQL code generates a database schema for an e-commerce website, which includes separate versions for physical and digital products.

## Ecommerce Physical Products

This SQL code creates a database schema for an e-commerce website. The schema consists of several tables, including users, products, reviews, orders, order_items, payments, and shipping. The tables are designed to capture information about users, products, reviews, and orders, as well as the details of the items ordered, the payments made, and the shipping information.

The schema uses primary keys and foreign keys to ensure data consistency and maintain relationships between the tables. Each table has a primary key column that uniquely identifies each row in the table. For example, the users table has a primary key column named user_id, while the products table has a primary key column named product_id. The reviews, orders, order_items, payments, and shipping tables also have primary key columns.

Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between the tables. For example, the reviews table has a foreign key product_id that references the product_id column in the products table, and a foreign key user_id that references the user_id column in the users table. Similarly, the orders table has a foreign key user_id that references the user_id column in the users table, and the order_items, payments, and shipping tables all have foreign keys that reference the order_id column in the orders table.

This schema is a solid foundation for an e-commerce website database, and can be used as a starting point for further development

## E-Commerce Website with Digital Products Database Code

This SQL code creates a database schema for an ecommerce website that offers digital products. The schema consists of three tables, including users, products, and downloads. The tables are designed to capture information about users, products, and downloads made by users.

The users table has columns for user_id, first_name, last_name, email, and password. The products table has columns for product_id, name, price, description, and category. The downloads table has columns for download_id, user_id, product_id, and download_date. Each table has a primary key column that uniquely identifies each row in the table.

Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between the tables. The downloads table has foreign keys that reference the user_id and product_id columns in the users and products tables, respectively. These foreign keys ensure that a download can only be associated with a valid user and a valid product.
